# File Q&A with Next.js and Flask

File Q&A is a web app that lets you find answers in your files. You can upload files and ask questions related to their content, and the app will use embeddings and GPT to generate answers from the most relevant files.

## Limitations

The app may sometimes generate answers that are not in the files, or hallucinate about the existence of files that are not uploaded.
